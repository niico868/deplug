                    In this series I will only speak about my personal thoughts, research and
                    decisions. We only make responsible investment
                    decisions over here. With all
                    investments there is a chance of winning and also a chance of losing. So I implore anyone reading this or interested in investing to do their own due
                    diligence before making any decisions and personally I think one should never
                    take financial advise directly and straightforwardly.

                        <text style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.8ch;">One of the easiest indexes, the S&P</text>
                        <br>
                        Overtime money loses its value due to inflation, at a conservative rate of
                        2% every year. We can prevent inflation from eating into our checkbooks by
                        investing in saving funds from banks or trust funds. Which in itself only give
                        a return of 4-7% dividends per annum.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Monetary investments that return more than this percentage simply aren't
                        realistic based on the fact that it is way too much. The most popularly known
                        way to realize these types of returns is to invest in shares. An easy way to
                        think about investing in shares is that buying a share in a company is like
                        owning a small percentage of it, and receiving dividends/profit based on your
                        percentage ownership.
                        <br>
                        Aside from navigating the market to check for expected growth, downturns and
                        profitability and purchasing shares in individual companies. It is generally
                        more commonplace to invest in funds that manage the purchase of multiple different
                        stock from varying markets using the capital of millions of individual investors.
                        <br>
                        Therefore resulting in x10 more stability in your returns as your dollar is pegged
                        against many different companies that operate in different markets that aren't
                        affected the same way by economic downturn or growth. So when one goes up or down
                        it is measured and the loss from one investment is out-weighed by the profit in others.
                        <br><br>
                        The profit difference between index investments and individual investments are that persons
                        are usually given a set percentage of returns per annum where as if persons were to
                        invest early in the stocks of a particular budding company which was to see growth, their capital
                        investment would grow exponentially as the stock value of that company grows. Resulting in
                        much higher profits. In the range of +30%, +100% even +%1000% in the case of early Tesla and Amazon investors.
                        <br>
                        For example; Tesla which had initial stock prices of around 50USD well into being publicly
                        traded and highs of a little more than 1,200USD up to November 2021. And Amazon which had initial stock prices of around 64USD well into being publicly
                        traded and highs of a little more than 3,500USD up to July 2021.
                        <br><em>Note: These rates are per share.</em>

                        <text style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.8ch;">What is a fund?</text>
                        <br>
                        A fund is where multiple investors pool their money which is invested by a fund
                        manager with the sole goal of generating increased profits. A fund manager being an
                        experienced financial expert who's financial decisions can be trusted.

                        <text style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.8ch;">What are indexes?</text>
                        <br>Indexes refer to collections of data from a chosen group of companies
                        highlighting best performers, slow to growth, drop in share prices etc. This data
                        is usually made up from a wide-swatch of companies in different industries such as
                        natural gas, technology, agriculture, manufacturing, clothing - anything that is up.
                        <br>
                        An index fund (IF) refers to funds (capital collectives) that are managed based on
                        their own indexes and change their investments in various companies based on that.
                        <br>

                        <text style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.8ch;">The beloved S&P</text>
                        <br>The S&P is a financial fund / index fund that invests in the top 500 US companies at any
                        particular point in time. For the past 60+ years the funds has had returns of
                        average 10%.
                        <br>
                        The fund self-cleanses based on company performance so investors
                         more or less act as a part of a school group project that do no work but
                        receive the rewards. Being totally made up of US companies this fund (S&P500) operates
                        similarly to the American economy. Even the growth curves of its share prices,
                        going up and down, matches that of the US economy over the past 40 years.
                        <br>
                        There are disadvantages to be noted in this as a downturn in the US economy
                        will see a downturn in the profitability of the S&P500. But the US economy,
                        despite downturns at times, has and is still the leader internationally,
                        soon to be surpassed by China in coming decades.
                        <br>
                        Side Note: Being US based stock, dividends are taxed by 30% leaving owners
                        with 70% profit per annum. Therefore, investing through international brokers
                        such as Vanguard and Blackrock allow persons to feel reduced taxation costs
                        of up to 15% (savings). Vanguard - VUSD | Blackrock - CSPX. These ETFs can be
                        accessed through "Interactive Brokers" as they have access to UK stock markets.

                        <text style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.8ch;">S&P500 Crash of '07
                        </text>
                        <br>
                        In 2007 the S&P500 was valued at 1,500USD per share growing
                        in tandum with the US economy from it's valuation of 114USD when it began publicly
                        trading in 1982. At that point there had been drops in the market before but in
                        2007 there were tremendous drops in share value at the start of the US financial
                        crisis; the recession of 2008.
                        The share price dropped by 51% leaving invested
                        parties in an almost immediate loss. And took 5 whole years to get back it's
                        previous valuation of 1,500USD.
                        <br>
                        Persons who would have bought-in in 2007
                        at close to 1,500USD made varying decisions. Some were scared by the decrease and
                        sold as they saw the price dropping gradually, thinking they would come out with a
                        loss. Whereas persons who held unto their positions and didn't sell would have seen it
                        re-establish itself as early as January 2013 and furthermore, see all time
                        high growths of as high as 4,697USD in November 2021.
                        <br>
                        I am stating this to say that long term investments such as index funds are
                        essentially that, long term investments. These are made for stores of money
                        over 5 – 10 years, sometimes even decades. So understanding the market and
                        having faith in your investment is crucial as testing times come, as they
                        always have.
                        <br>
                        Two things are certain with the S&P500. There will and has been
                        dips as the American economy and financial industry have had its challenges.
                        And there will and have only been upward growth as time goes on.
                        Long and short of the story; your future self will NEVER regret investing.
                        High-interest debt paid off – these compound the same as dividends and could
                        counteract any real growth. Start an emergency fund (3 to 6 months living
                        expenses). This allows for an extra layer of stability in times and cases
                        where cash funds are needed. And don’t invest money that you might need in the
                        next 3-5 years
